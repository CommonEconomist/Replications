Pattern in Escalations in Insurgent and Terrorist Activity
==============

**Replication status:** *Successful*

The study by Johnson et al. (2011) in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6038/81.abstract) on escalation patterns in insurgencies is one in a series of papers that uses relatively simple mathematical models to study patterns in violence. 
Such as the study by Bohorquez et al. (2009) in [Nature Letters](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7275/full/nature08631.html) and Johnson et al. (2013) in [Scientific Reports](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/131210/srep03463/full/srep03463.html). 
Much to their credit the authors made all their data publicly available and included some notes on how the data was processed and how they got their results using Open Office. 
In this replication I focus on figure 1 presented in their paper which looks at Afghanistan and used R to automate the estimation of the model for the various provinces in Afghanistan. 

The following files are included:

* `afghanistan.csv` contains the dataset
* `Afghanistan.R` replicates their figure 1

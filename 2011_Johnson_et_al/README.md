Pattern in Escalations in Insurgent and Terrorist Activity
==============

**Replication status:** *Successful*

Johnson et al. ([2011](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6038/81.abstract)) study escalation patterns in the war in Afghanistan, and fits in a series of studies that use a relatively simple mathematical model to analyse violence patterns. 
Other examples include Bohorquez et al. ([2009](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7275/full/nature08631.html)) and Johnson et al. ([2013](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/131210/srep03463/full/srep03463.html)). 
Much to their credit the authors have made all their data publicly available, inlcuding some notes on how the data was processed and how the results were obtained using Open Office.
Here I focus on figure 1 from their paper using R to automate the estimation of the model for various provinces in Afghanistan.

* `afghanistan.csv` contains the data
* `Afghanistan.R` replicates figure 1

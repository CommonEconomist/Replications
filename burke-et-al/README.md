**Abstract**

Within the quantitative literature on violent armed conflict there is a heated debate on the effect of climate change on the incidence of civil conflict. While this discussion predominantly focuses on the robustness of results to different model specifications and extended datasets, generated predictions are largely ignored and not included in the analysis. This is surprising given the relevance of predictive power in the field of conflict studies and concerning climate change forecasts. This study illustrates that examination of a model's predictive power can be a useful analytical tool to scrutinise a model's performance. Focusing on the link between temperature and conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1981-2001 I find that although the regression model has large in-sample predictive power, the performance of the temperature variable is low. Generating out-of-sample predictions for 2003-2013 illustrates that temperature has almost no predictive power.

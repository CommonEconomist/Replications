Contagious Rebellion and Preemptive Repression
==============

**Replication status:** *Successful*

This is a very narrow replication of the study by Danneman and Ritter (2014 )in the [JCR](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/2/254.abstract).
I used their replication dataset and code to learn how to do Bayesian estimation and work with multilevel models in R using JAGS. 
The replication is very simple and only focuses on estimating model 1 with JAGS rather than with OpenBUGS. 
In the future I might extend this replication for instance looking at how to reproduce replicable results. 

The following files are included:

* `2014_Danneman_Ritter_JCR.RData` is the replication dataset
* `model1.R` replicates the results for model 1 in table 1
* `mode1.txt` is the model

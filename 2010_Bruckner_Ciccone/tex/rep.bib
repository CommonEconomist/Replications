  abstract = {Higher national incomes are correlated with lower political instability.
	We test three theories linking income to conflict using a new database
	of export price shocks. Price shocks have no effect on new conflicts,
	even large shocks in high-risk nations. Rising prices, however, lead
	to shorter, less intense wars. This evidence contradicts the theory
	that rising state revenues incentivize attempts at capture, but accords
	with two theories: that rising revenues improve state counter- insurgency
	capacity and reduce individual incentives to fight in existing conflicts.
	Conflict onset and continuation follow different processes. Ignoring
	this time dependence generates mistaken conclusions about income
	and instability.},

  abstract = {In the period 1946-2001, there were 225 armed conflicts and 34 of
	them were active in all of or part of 2001. Armed conflict remains
	a serious problem in the post-Cold War period. For three decades,
	the Correlates of War project has served as the main supplier of
	reliable data used in longitudinal studies of external and internal
	armed conflict. The COW datasets on war use the relatively high threshold
	of 1,000 battle-deaths. The Uppsala dataset on armed conflict has
	a lower threshold, 25 annual battle-deaths, but has so far been available
	for only the post-Cold War period. This dataset has now been backdated
	to the end of World War II. This article presents a report on armed
	conflict based on this backdate as well as another annual update.
	It presents the procedures for the backdating, as well as trends
	over time and breakdowns for the type of conflict. It assesses the
	criteria for measuring armed conflict and discusses some directions
	for future data collection in this area.},

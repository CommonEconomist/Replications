Using Power Laws to Estimate Conflict Size
==============

**Replication status:** *Successful*

Friedman [(2014)](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/59/7/1216) illustrates how power laws can be used to estimate conflict size,
using the number of Native American and US fatalities in the American Indian Wars (1776-1890) as an example. 

The following files are included:

* `American Indian Wars event data.dta` is the original dataset
* `replication.R` is the replication script.

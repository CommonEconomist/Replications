# Replications

Given the cumulative nature of research, my work often build upon that of others. 
This entails that in order to familiarise myself with certain subjects I try to replicate existing papers. 
Additionally, I often use data from existing studies to test out different estimation methods.
This repository contains the results of the studies that I have replicated along with the code and data. 
The table below provides an overview of the replicated studies and whether the replication was successful or not. 
For more details on the individual studies; please see their respective folder.

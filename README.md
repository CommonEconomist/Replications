# Replications

Since my research often builds upon the work of others, I sometimes have to check wheter results are replicable using different data or other software. 
I also often use data from existing studies to test out different estimation methods etc. 
This repository presents the results of these replications along with the data and code that I've used. 
Below is a table with the covered studies and replication result, see the individual folder of each study for some more details.

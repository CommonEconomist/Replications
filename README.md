## Replications

This repository contains data and code for a number of studies that I have tried to replicate. 
In most cases these replications were the result of trying things our in R, familiarising myself with particular topics, or just plain procrastination. 
For the large majority of studies I was able to replicate the original results; in unsuccessful cases the failure was often due to software issues (I guess).<br> 

For more information and details on the individual studies; please consult the respective folder.

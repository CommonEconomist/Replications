# Replications

This repository contains data and code for a number of studies that I have tried to replicate. 
These replication exercises are often the result of trying to familiarise myself with certain methods, testing things out in R, or just procrastination. 
For more details on the individual studies; please consult the respective folder. 
In some incidental cases I have written up the results of the replication (see links).

# Replications
This repository contains a number of replication attempts of other studies. 
Often my work uses or builds upon the data of others and I have to check whether their results are replicable using
different data or other software. 
For each of the studies I included a short description of the study in the readme-file as well as a short summary of 
the replication results.
